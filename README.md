# Framework7 v3 Redux App Template

This template leverages the [framework7-redux](https://github.com/bencompton/framework7-redux) plug-in and demonstrates creating an app with Framework7, React, and Redux.

To get started, clone this repo as whatever you want to name your app:

```
git clone https://github.com/framework7io/framework7-react-app-template/ my-app
```

Running the app:

```
npm install
npm start
```

To build your app for deployment, run:

```
npm run build
```

The build folder will then contain all of your app's files, optimized and ready for deployment.

This template was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). It is suggested that you read more about Create React App to understand the full capabilities of the toolset.
